My name is Roman Pavlenko. My favourite sport is chess. The reason is that, in my opinion, we are all playing it all the time. What I mean is that in life, we constantly have to choose what to focus on and what to sacrifice. Thatâ€™s why, for me, this game reflects human life.

So, you might ask, why do I usually say that my favourite sport is padel? The point is that any sport can effectively represent this idea. And at the moment, paired sports with clearly defined opponents, often played outdoors, are much better for physical fitness and community building.

My favorite food is salad, because we can make it easily and everywhere. It could be hearty with meat or fish, or very light, made exclusively from vegetables.

As a kid, I practiced pole vaulting and reached a personal best of 4.15 meters.
